                <p>We are a project to find the best prices for your favorite games. It's was a project for study made by <a href="https://github.com/hugofolloni">Hugo Folloni</a> to learn React. This is one of my first projects, where I learn how to sync my website with APIs and create lists where the user can search and find info about what he want. So, we are just me! Hope you can buy your games based on my search and huge thanks to CheapShark for creating this API and allow me to create this.</p>
