## 🗒️ About this project
A website that shows the best price for games, based on an API. The user can search for games by name, and the website will show the best price for the game. Also, we have a list of games under 10USD and the top metacritic score games.

## 🧔 User Story

Also, the user can click on the Under10 and TopGames buttons, and we'll show the list of games under 10USD and the top metacritic score games. When he choose a game, he can click on it and we'll show the store that sells tha game, the price, the metacritic score an a couple more details about that game, with links to both the store and the game on metacritic.
